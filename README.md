# Algo-Visualizer
An algorithm visualizer tool of data algorithm such as Dijsktra’s or A* or bi-directional algorithm, greedy algorithm etc. 
The tool would allow students to see how algorithm make its path all the way to find its goal. 
This project is intended to create an exploration environment, in which students can learn through experimentation. 
This tool can be used as an effective supplement to the traditional classroom education and textbook for Data Structures and Algorithms courses

# ALGORITHM’s IMPLEMENTED IN OUR PROJECT SO FAR :
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Search
3. Greedy Best-first Search
4. Convergent Algorithm
5. Bidirectional Algorithm
6. Breath-first Search
7. Depth-first Search
